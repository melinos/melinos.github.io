Welcome to my personal website !

I am currently the group leader of the [Visual Computing Group (VCG)](https://vcg.cyens.org.cy/) at CYENS Center of Excellence, where I lead a team of research scientists working on deep neural networks for solving tasks in scene understanding and visual recognition. I am also a Senior Research Scientist in the Department of Computer Science of the University of Cyprus, where I carry out research, supervise students and teach courses in the broad area of visual computing. 

My research spans the areas of computer vision, machine learning, and computer graphics, focusing on data-driven methods for learning semantics from 3D and 2D data. I am particularly interested in deep neural network architectures for acquiring, modelling, and understanding the semantics of real-world environments at multiple scales, ranging from objects, scenes, buildings, and ultimately entire cities. This knowledge powers intelligent tools for scene understanding which have important applications in engineering, artificial intelligence, robotics, and extended reality. Have a look at my [publications](https://melinos.github.io/publications/) for more information.

I got an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Cambridge in 2010, before going to University College London where I got a PhD in 2015, working in the [Smart Geometry Processing Group](http://geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/). I was supervised by Professor Niloy Mitra, working on collections of 3D objects to develop novel representations and shape analysis algorithms for modelling, learning and using object structure. I then joined the University of Cyprus for a Postdoc, where I focused on deep learning for 3D shape analysis, including [semantic segmentation](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalo/papers/shapepfcn/index.html) and [style recognition](http://vcc.szu.edu.cn/research/2017/style/). 

I grew up in Cyprus, a tiny island in the Eastern Mediterranean. Have a look at my [CV](https://melinos.github.io/assets/pdf/averkiou_cv.pdf) for more information.
