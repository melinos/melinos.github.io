Welcome to my personal website !

I am currently an Associate (Research) Professor and Group Leader of the Visual Computing Group (VCG) at the CYENS Centre of Excellence in Cyprus, where I supervise a team of PhD students working in artificial intelligence (AI). Concurrently, as an adjunct research scientist at University of Cyprus, I supervise post-graduate students and teach courses in AI topics such as deep learning and computer vision. I am also the co-founder and R&D Director of MindXs, a health-tech startup utilizing AI for automating EEG brain signal analysis.

My research lies in artificial intelligence, specifically at the intersection of machine learning and computer vision, with a focus on discriminative and generative deep neural models for 3D vision. In my view, achieving strong AI is closely linked to making real and virtual worlds indistinguishable. The primary goal of my work is therefore to bridge their gap, to the point where the virtual becomes seamlessly integrated with the real. To achieve this, I develop novel methods aimed at both understanding real-world environments and generating virtual environments across multiple scales, from objects to buildings and entire cities. My research enables AI tools advancing engineering, robotics, and extended reality, but also revolutionizing areas like autonomous systems, urban planning, remote sensing and healthcare. Have a look at my [publications](https://melinos.github.io/publications/) for more information.

I got an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Cambridge and a PhD from University College London, working on machine learning for discovering shape structure. I was a founding member of the [Smart Geometry Processing Group](http://geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/), supervised by Prof. Niloy Mitra. After my PhD I joined UCY as a research scientist, where I worked on deep learning for shape understanding, including [semantic segmentation](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalo/papers/shapepfcn/index.html) and [style recognition](http://vcc.szu.edu.cn/research/2017/style/). 

I grew up in Cyprus, a small island in the Eastern Mediterranean. Have a look at my [CV](https://melinos.github.io/assets/pdf/averkiou_cv.pdf) for more information.
